\chapter{Conclusion} \label{chap:chap-5}

This thesis is centered around precision measurements of the Higgs boson properties (width) using the $H^{(*)} \to ZZ^{(*)} \to 4\ell$ decay channel in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$\,TeV collected by the CMS experiment, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138\,fb$^{-1}$. The results are summarized in Table~\ref{table:widthoffshellcomb}. The strength of off-shell Higgs production is also measured, excluding the no off-shell production hypothesis at 3.8 standard deviations, after combination with $H \to ZZ \to 2\ell2\nu$. 

A simultaneous fit to on- and off-shell production in the $4\ell$ final state, combined with results from the $2\ell2\nu$ final state, gives us our most data-inclusive measurement to date and yields $\Gamma_H = 3.0^{+2.0}_{-1.5}$\,MeV, consistent with the SM prediction of 4.1\,MeV. 
% Combining data from Runs 1 and 2 improves the mass measurement to $m_H = 125.08 \pm 0.10\,\text{(stat)} \pm 0.05\,\text{(syst)}\,$GeV$ = 125.08 \pm 0.12\,$GeV, the most precise single-channel result to date. 

These results provide stringent tests of the Standard Model and establish an experimental baseline for characterizing Higgs boson properties. Looking ahead, this analysis provides a robust foundation for future studies targeting deviations from Standard Model expectations. 

The methods and statistical techniques developed here are directly extensible to searches for anomalous Higgs couplings and BSM effects in the $HVV$ vertex. This framework will support increasingly precise constraints as we move toward a Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) description of the Higgs boson and probe Electroweak Symmetry Breaking (EWSB) to uncover potential new physics.






% As larger datasets become available with Run 3, particularly including more statistics at higher energies, this framework will hopefully support increasingly precise constraints as we move toward a Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) description of the Higgs boson. These studies are essential for probing the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism and for uncovering potential signs of new physics.

% The precision achieved in this thesis reinforces the central role of the Higgs boson as a portal to new physics and sets the stage for future explorations into its interactions, structure, and possible extensions within the SMEFT paradigm.



% The mass is measured with an uncertainty of $\pm0.12$\,GeV, and the most precise single-channel measurement to date is achieved by combining Run~1 and Run~2 data: $m_H = 125.08 \pm 0.12\,\GeV$. The Higgs boson width is constrained to $\Gamma_H = 3.0^{+2.0}_{-1.5}\,\MeV$, consistent with the Standard Model prediction of $4.1\,\MeV$, and the hypothesis of no off-shell Higgs boson production is excluded at the level of 3.8 standard deviations.

A simultaneous fit to on- and off-shell production in the four-lepton final state, combined with results from $H \to 2\Pell2\PGn$, yields $\Gamma_H = 3.0^{+2.0}_{-1.5}\,\MeV$, consistent with the SM prediction of 4.1\,MeV.


% A measurement of the Higgs boson mass ($m_H$) and width ($\Gamma_H$) is presented using $\PH \to \PZ\PZ \to 4\Pell$ decays ($\Pell = \Pe,\,\PGm$) in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13\,\TeV$, recorded by the CMS experiment with an integrated luminosity of 138\,fb$^{-1}$. The mass is measured using on-shell events, yielding $m_H = 125.04 \pm 0.11\,\text{(stat)} \pm 0.05\,\text{(syst)}\,\GeV = 125.04 \pm 0.12\,\GeV$, consistent with the expected precision. A 95\% confidence level upper limit of $\Gamma_H < 330\,\MeV$ is obtained from on-shell production.
