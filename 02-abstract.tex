The Higgs boson is the last observed piece of the Standard Model of particle physics, and due to its couplings to other fundamental particles, provides a promising portal through which we can potentially probe new physics beyond the Standard Model. This thesis revolves around an analysis which incorporates the full Run 2 dataset from the CMS experiment at the LHC to make precision measurements of the Higgs boson, utilizing a combination of its on- and off-shell production. It also set the stage for novel extensions to analysis of Higgs boson production in the off-shell region, so that future endeavors can better constrain coupling strengths between the Higgs boson and other particles in the search for Beyond-the-Standard-Model (BSM) physics.
