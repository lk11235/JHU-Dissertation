The Higgs boson is the last observed piece of the Standard Model of particle physics, and due to its couplings to other fundamental particles, provides a promising portal through which we can potentially probe new physics beyond the Standard Model. This thesis revolves around an analysis which incorporates the full Run2 dataset from the CMS experiment at the LHC to make our current best measurements of the Higgs boson's width (or lifetime). This analysis also sets the stage for novel extensions to analysis of Higgs boson production in the off-shell region, so that future endeavors can better constrain coupling strengths between the Higgs boson and other particles.
